Sat Dec 28 15:31:46 2024 OK, we tried to make a
'fresh start' here but code dependencies pulled in
pretty much everything from the BVBrain physics..

[1:

Sat Dec 28 15:33:48 2024 Did manage to get rid of
a chunk of files, though, like from obsolete
configuration automation attemps.. So, whatever.

[2:

Sat Dec 28 15:34:41 2024 So, let's migrate our
existing to-do in here since that's where it
really belongs:

TODO
(DONE previously) - reboot lcf5820c
(DONE previously) - make BVBrain2025?
[6: Sun Dec 29 11:48:08 2024 So far just 'SFCG', but
DONE :6] - three new grey sensors
[31: Fri Jan 10 01:47:51 2025
DONE :31] - line-follwing demo
[32: DONE  :32] - new grip "Track", alternate to Explore
[33: Fri Jan 10 01:48:01 2025 mostly
DONE :33] - beevee follows lines in track
   until yellow/red grip changes

and next up is three new gray sensors. Let's start
with one next front-and-center gray sensor and see
how that goes..[3:

Sat Dec 28 16:17:54 2024 OK made SFCG - Sensor
Front Center Grey - plus the associated
paraphernalia..

Now need to hack in PyBulletTime..

Sun Dec 29 02:14:24 2024 OK let's get refreshed

[7:

Sun Dec 29 11:50:03 2024 OK so Beevee's running
again as plausibly as ever.. with a new
front-and-center grey sensor.. so let's go for
grip TRACK, as a genuine accept-no-substitutes new
track. [8:

Sun Dec 29 12:38:40 2024 So okay.. how do we want
to compute the main TRACK signal? In the abstract
first..

BLG = if SFLG > max/2     # boolean 'left is grey'
BCG = if SFCG > max/2     # boolean 'center is grey'
BRG = if SFRG > max/2     # boolean 'right is grey'

if BLG == BCG then turn right else
if BRG == BCG then turn left

umm let's start with proportional control here..

signed err = SFCG - max/2;

so if err == 0 make no drive changes

[9:

Sun Dec 29 12:58:43 2024 So, 'no drive changes'
means we remember desired wheel speeds? Vs some
kind of bang bang control? If we remember it we
have to maintain it..

that's not really err up there, though; need to
compare to the outrigger greys.

could we want the center to be the average of the
outriggers? that seems kind of fun. with signed
error coming off the difference..

[10:

Sun Dec 29 13:12:27 2024

avggrey = (SFLG + SFRG)/2

but,, avg is symmetric.. need to get a sign change
in there somewhere, right? half the difference of
the outriggers?

err = avggrey-SFCG

SFLG   SFRG   SFCG  avg   err
255     0     0     127   127
255     0     100   127    27   too right
255     0     150   127   -23   too left
0     255     0     127   127
0     255     100   127    27
0     255     150   127   -23

lerr = SFLG-2*SFCG  # <0 turn right
rerr = SFRG-2*SFCG  # <0 turn left
err = lerr - rerr

SFLG   SFRG   SFCG   lerr  rerr  err
255     0     0      255     0   255       max left
255     0     100     45  -200  -155       hard right
255     0     150    -45  -300  -345
0     255     0        0   255  -255       max right
0     255     100
0     255     150

diff = SFLG - SFRG
adiff = abs(diff)
err = diff - 2*SFCG

if both low stop and turn right
if both high stop and turn left

if adiff < C   # same color outriggers
  if SFLG < C forward right fixed
  else if SFLG > C forward left fixed
else           # opposite outriggers
  if SFLG < SFRG
    SFLG <-> SFRG
    SFCG = 255-SFCG
  # now L >= R and big SFCG means more right

  lerr = SFLG - 2*SFCG
  if lerr > C then forward left lerr
  else if lerr < -C then forward right lerr

[11:

Mon Dec 30 00:39:08 2024 Well, so making little
perl spikes to try stuff out.. it seems like the
idea of checking which side the center value is
closer to is helpful for deciding drive
directions. So my ambitions are growing a little
bit again..

We also want indications of how good our tracking
is, to - for example - consider changing speed. So
our augmented outputs could be something like

  (inputsValid, trackingError)

where inputsValid means the outriggers are
essentially opposite greys, and then the
trackingError is which way and how far the center
is from 50% grey, with trackingError < 0 meaning
(say) too far left and > 0 meaning too far right.

and we have a second mapping step from that to

  (leftWheelSpeed, rightWheelSpeed)

where an additional state variable:

  (currentSpeed)

is assumed, along with perhaps an external
parameters

  (minSpeed,maxSpeed)

with something like

  currentSpeed = a*maxSpeed + (1-a)*currentSpeed

if inputsValid and trackingError < errThresh, or

  currentSpeed = b*minSpeed + (1-b)*currentSpeed

otherwise. (with a < b < 1, probably.)

and then something like

  (leftWheelSpeed,rightWheelSpeed) =
    (currentSpeed - trackingError,
     currentSpeed + trackingError)

or vv.

andwala.
[12:

Mon Dec 30 11:12:26 2024 So okay our current d.pl
seems vaguely plausible enough to think about
moving to ulam. But I'd maybe like a few steps

TODO
[18: Tue Dec 31 23:24:35 2024
DONE :18] - Review GREG format and flow
[74: Sat Jan 18 01:32:41 2025 TRAK.ulam,
DONE :74] - Frame up TRACK.ulam analogously
[19: Provisionally anyway
DONE :19] - Decide where to put TRACK controller
[20:

[34: DONE  :34] - Demo track controller reporting signals
[35: DONE  :35] - Demo track sending random motor commands
[75: DONE  :75] - Come make more to-do

[13:

Mon Dec 30 11:22:10 2024 OK so we have
TrackGrip.ulam analogous to OrientGrip.ulam. It
should be routing signals and stuff.[14:

Mon Dec 30 11:24:55 2024 Are we thinking TRACK is
another output on xbar.GREYS?

:14]

:13]
:12]
:11]
[15:

Mon Dec 30 20:31:52 2024 Okay, so we have one
issue to deal with here.. We've got

  constant Unsigned cGRIP_TRACK = 8u; //< handled by TrackGrip

in GripInfoMap, but we've also got

    local typedef XBarSpace2D GripSource; //< What grid we are built to live in..
 .. quark TAP : GripStgT(GripSource.cBITS) + DTU + QDebugUtils {

in TAP.ulam, and a path for cBITS leading to

    local typedef LocalSpaceRect2DT(6u,0u,3u) QSpace2D;
                                          ^^

so cBITS==3 so the maximum grip number is 7..[16:

Tue Dec 31 08:58:42 2024 Buuuut we might have one
bit to spare? --

      /*__________________________________________________

..ah but that's only because we cut QDebugUtils
back to a single-bit Bool.. urgh.

:16]

:15]
[17:

Tue Dec 31 23:23:53 2024 OK so almost next year.
We need an actual implementation strategy for
TRAK.ulam
[21:

Tue Dec 31 23:25:08 2024 We're supposed to be
reporting signals as a to-do. That should be easy,
right, haha?

Let's review the plan such as it is.

What state will we keep?
 - latest SL,SC,SR?
 - So we're a ternary op?[22:

Tue Dec 31 23:52:06 2024 I see

    quark HOpTernary : HOpArgsT(3u) { }

in TermHOp.ulam, but nobody's using it. [23:

Wed Jan  1 00:08:11 2025 Well, now TRAK is using
it.. or 'using' it anyway; not functionally..
after tearing out a ton of copied-from-GREG's
state to make room for it. Currently at:

      /*__________________________________________________
      | COMPONENTS of TRAK <60> (63 bits/8 unused):
      |
      | Pos	| Bits	| Name	| Type <classid>
      | 0	| 3	| mState	| Unsigned(3)
      | 3	| 8	| mEventCounter	| Unsigned(8)
      | 11	| 0	| super	| HOpTernary <167>
      | 11	| 0	| base	| Grip <123>
      | 11	| 0	| base	| Fail <65>
      | 11	| 0	| base	| UrSelf <0>
      | 11	| 0	| base	| DTU <66>
      | 11	| 0	| base	| GripStg <126>
      | 11	| 1	| base	| QDebugUtils <67>
      | 12	| 3	| base	| TAP <102>
      | 15	| 6	| base	| GripStgT(6u) <134>
      | 21	| 0	| base	| TermMotor <131>
      | 21	| 0	| base	| TermHOp <168>
      | 21	| 42	| base	| HOpArgsT(3) <172>
      |___________________________________________________
      */ //gcnl:NodeBlockClass.cpp:2644

which seems fine for now considering we think we
won't need mEventCounter (and maybe not mState?).

So what do we need?
 - Does HOpTernary provide signal occupancies? It
   must, right?[24: Wed Jan  1 00:24:15 2025 Well,
   SlotSig provides occupancy so yes.

 - So at a minimum we can wait for full occupancy
   and then do an update?

 - Or as a middlemum we could do an update
   whenever there's a new signal of any sort? Or a
   changing signal (bleh), or whenever there's
   room to ship a result?

 - Or we decouple the two and update the signal
   internally whenever we see a signal, and
   broadcast our latest result whenever there's
   room to ship. And add back in an event counter
   or whatever to flush sufficiently stale stuff.

[25:

Wed Jan  1 00:54:46 2025 What if anything might
TRAK.mState represent, beyond what we can deduce
from signal occupancies? Well, it could represent
a chosen 'higher level goal' like 'go til RED' or
'stop at next intersection' or whatever.

That seems plausible enough. So let's leave it in
there for now, but only implement a 'go forever'
[26:

Wed Jan  1 01:13:11 2025 Don't really remember the
TermHOp API so let's review..

We've got API service Bool TermHOp.accept(..) that
stashes signals in mHOperands, using API prereq
Int TermHOp.sigToSlot(..) to decide where to put
signals. [27:

Wed Jan  1 01:51:39 2025 OK so we implement
TRAK.sigToSlot(..).

Now, we've also got to do something about
execute(..), I assume.[28:

Wed Jan  1 04:15:14 2025 Current code from GREG
does:

 1: refresh gripnum (keep)
 2: bail unless isOrientGripNum (rewrite)
 3: dispatch to executeSTATE(..)

[29:

Fri Jan 10 01:40:58 2025 OK let's catch up here..

[36:

Fri Jan 10 01:48:33 2025 OK claimed to-dos. Some
more -

TODO
[69: Sat Jan 18 01:31:42 2025

DONE :73] - Come make more to-do

[37:

Fri Jan 10 01:52:21 2025 OK well that shudewit for
a while..

Let's find some fixed point code for
  inspiration.[38:

Fri Jan 10 02:40:40 2025 Wow having trouble
finding prior fixed point code! find/grep still
running with nothing so far.. but let's go ahead
and start roughing up a new one from scratch. At
the very least it might remind me more clearly
where I've done this before..[39:

Sat Jan 11 02:49:16 2025 OK, implemented a
not-entirely-sucky FixedPoint.ulam over in
../../FixedPoint , with a smattering of tests in
an S.ulam. It's got operator overloads for + - * /
and += etc and > < etc, and even has an apparently
functional Self.printTo(ByteStreamWriter &) that
prints a decimal point and a plausible number of
fractional digits and everything..

I think I should not spend too much more time
shining it up but should instead just fucking push
it and switch back to Beevee.[40:

Sat Jan 11 03:05:23 2025 OK, made
DaveAckley/FixedPoint and pushed to it.
[42:

Sat Jan 11 03:06:33 2025 So now perhaps we should
think about a PD form and break into a new element
to hold TRAK PD state..[43:

Sat Jan 11 03:53:54 2025 Well, shined up
FixedPoint a little bit instead. Sosumi.

:43]

:42]
:40]

:39]

:38]

:37]

:36]

:30]
[44:

Sat Jan 11 07:42:18 2025 So OK. Make an empty
TRAKPD.ulam . Let's think a little.

So, we're going to need

 - notions of 'line position'
   and 'error in line position'
   [45: Sat Jan 11 08:11:43 2025
   = maybe range like 0..256 is enough?
     when there's a valid signal, meaning like
     L   C   R   SIG  ~SIG
     0   0 255    0    255
     0   1 255    1    254
     0 127 255  127    128
     0 255 255  255      0
   255   0   0  255      0
   255   1   0  254      1
   255 127   0  128 ?  127
   255 255   0    0    255

   = and then could we say ~SIG is 'line
     rightness'? 0 means line is way left, 255
     means line is way right, 127 or 128 means
     line is dead on balls accurate? I suppose we
     could take 127.5 as our default goal since
     we're using hot damn fixed points.
   :45]
 - notion of time; in particular, when to update
   the PD state. I'm thinking maybe trigger on the
   arrival of SFRG signals, since they're
   (currently) the farthest from TRAK in the xbar.
   While remembering prior signals from everybody,
   so on those occasions where SFRG arrives early,
   the other signals will be a bit out of date,
   but not missing. Can have a watchdog too maybe.
 - notion of 'motor speed' and 'desired motor
   speed'.

[46:

Sat Jan 11 08:16:18 2025 And maybe we could use
like FixedPoint(10u,10u) for general work, giving
like +-500 range and like 0.001 increments? We
could use bigger for local var calculations if we
wanted. We'll see.

And we want what in persistent store?
 - last error for D
 - integral errors for I
 - desired motor speed?

And somehow we're going to need to come up with P,
I, and D parameters. Maybe we could tune them
'once' and just store small tweaks on the
defaults? We can certainly just tune them 'once'
to get started.

[47:

Sat Jan 11 08:36:00 2025 I was also hoping to use
fixed point to store running errors caused by
our seemingly-quite-coarse motor speeds, to use
like in Brensenham's algorithm, so that if we want
like 1.7 speed we'll do a 1 and then have .7 speed
error 'left over'. so if we want 1.7 again the
next time, we'll have 1.7+.7 = 2.4 'speed
available', so we'll go speed 2 with .4 left, and
so on..

But maybe that comes out in the wash with feedback
control? We just do perhaps round(desired) and get
2 for 1.7, and that'll be too fast so eventually
we'll want to do say 1.3 and round that to 1 and
so forth.

Have to see.
[48:

Sat Jan 11 08:59:22 2025 OK for starters we're
going with

    element TRAKPD {
      typedef FixedPoint(10u,10u) FP500;
      FP500 mLastError;
      FP500 mIntegralErrors;

      typedef FixedPoint(6u,8u) FP30;
      FP30 mTargetSpeed;
    }

in all our ignorance, leaving 17 bits -

      | COMPONENTS of TRAKPD <170> (54 bits/17 unused):
      |
      | Pos	| Bits	| Name	| Type <classid>
      | 0	| 20	| mLastError	| FixedPoint(10,10) <120>
      | 20	| 20	| mIntegralErrors	| FixedPoint(10,10) <120>
      | 40	| 14	| mTargetSpeed	| FixedPoint(6,8) <119>
      | 54	| 0	| super	| UrSelf <0>

with no clue, for example, about how we'll cleanly
map between differing FP sizes, since we can't
declare template functions in the C++ style.

But could we get a bit of code?
[49:

Sat Jan 11 10:01:46 2025 OK, we have a TRAKPD
getting built by TRAK, and an empty
TRAKPD.update(..)  method..[50:

Sat Jan 11 10:03:19 2025 So we have a void*-ish
kind of issue because the guts of TRAK behavior
are handled by TermHOp, using calldowns back into
TRAK.. which means we can't pass a local struct
through to represent/identify the TRAKPD.

Well so I guess the point is I'm not supposed to
be finding/making the TRAKPD so soon. I should do
it in TRAK.execute(..), where we're back in
control?

:50]

:49]
:48]
:47]
:46]
:44]
[51:

Mon Jan 13 23:28:25 2025 OK, so Beevee's going
pretty damn fast at this point, and I still only
have a 'P' controller, with no 'D' let alone
'I'.[53:

Tue Jan 14 10:37:48 2025 So I guess an
increasingly urgent current question is when do we
start using the foggen fixed point package, here.
We're supposed to reimplement the existing 'P'
controller using it.

[54:

Tue Jan 14 10:58:39 2025 Well, let's try it. Can
we maybe make a little plan of attack?

TODO
[55: Tue Jan 14 11:05:02 2025 Yes it is
DONE :55] - Have TRAK deploy a TRAKPD nearby (is it already
   doing that?)
[56: Tue Jan 14 16:00:06 2025
DONE :56] - Try to get .mLastError to do a fast backwards
   averaging of the existing mapio tracking error.
[57: While logging the fractional error!
DONE :57] - See that running
[58:

Tue Jan 14 16:00:57 2025 So I think we should make
a new mapio that produces a tracking error in like
-128..127 or something, and everybody else is
trying to zero that. And returns valid/invalid on
top of that.
[59:

Wed Jan 15 02:50:39 2025 OK, so we're running a
FixedPoint-based control loop now, and so far it
looks like we're terrifically over-controlling
things. Which is fine for starters - we want to
get an explicit kP parameter in there to scale
things (down initially).[60:

Wed Jan 15 08:00:19 2025 OK, so where should we
get our kP from? We want it to be something that
can become runtime-configurable, down the road?

[61:

Wed Jan 15 08:08:24 2025 Let's ask TRAKPD for it,
but have TRAKPD hard-code default values for now.

So the robot research lab 'tuning a pid' page says

     What I do is I calculate the highest possible
     error I could get and find the coefficient
     that converts that max error to a value equal
     to my speed.

So in our case our max error is 255 (it's apparent
that they mean max(allerrors) rather than
max(allerrors)-min(allerrors).) So if we're
thinking 'my speed' is some slow target like 3?
For starters? Then kP is like

  3 = 255 * kP
  kP = 3/255

or maybe let's say our initial target speed is
like 10. That seems a fair midpoint. That's kP ==
0.039 or so. (Noting in passing the demo they're
doing apparently never runs the motors backwards,
so they're mapping into 0..maxspeed, not
-maxspeed..maxspeed. So a possible factor of 2.)

And we'll set kD (and kI, if we have it) to 0 for
starters.
[62:

Wed Jan 15 10:41:50 2025 Hmm, it's looking like
our FP500 fixed point, despite a 'full 14 bits' of
fraction, isn't really enough to represent our kP
scaling. I think we need to do a little
'preconditioning' on the raw error - like dividing
it by 16 or 10 or something..[63:

Wed Jan 15 15:21:49 2025 OK, well an 'all FP500'
control loop is now handling Beevee's tracking and
doing okayish. We still have kD set to zero,
though. And before I change that I want to get
'stochastic rounding' working first, so that, for
example 1.75 produces 2 three-quarters of the time
and 1 one-quarter of the time. Want to see if I
can see a difference just with that.[64:

Wed Jan 15 17:01:12 2025 OK it looks like
my hacked-up 'stochastic rounding' (which is a
real wikipedia grade thing, it turns out) may be
working plausibly, at least for non-negative
inputs..

I think it's time to consider a non-zero kD.[65:

Wed Jan 15 17:10:49 2025 Buut actually it's time
to cook dinner.
[66:

Wed Jan 15 17:19:43 2025 Have a little more time
here actually actually. Robot Research Lab
suggests like kD value 10 to 20 times the kP.

Let's try 10 for starters..[67:

Fri Jan 17 09:20:48 2025 OK, have done lots of
twiddling and running, and now think we want to
rework the tracking error to consider the front
outer grey sensors as well as the center grey - to
put some consideration for maintaining max/min or
min/max relationships between the outer sensors.

Have to get that to integrate with the values
flipping as we cross tiles. Suspect we may need a
little visit from Mr. State? To know if inputs
were valid last time, and if so, which phase we
were in?

Sat Jan 18 01:22:27 2025 OK enough playing around
with our 'PD controller'. Time for more specific

TODO
[76: Sat Jan 18 01:33:09 2025
DONE :76] - Claim prior to-dos
[83: Mon Jan 20 09:49:11 2025
DONE :83] - Brainstorm/develop 'tile clock' signal format
[84: CLOK does it
DONE :84] - TRAK and/or TRAKPD generates tile clock
[85: DONE  :85] - Maybe lay a new xbar to handle it?
[86: Mon Jan 20 09:49:44 2025 GTCC does it
DONE :86] - At least make a stub somewhere that counts
   tile clock ticks

[77:

Sat Jan 18 01:40:03 2025 OK, 'tile clock'.

Basic states:
           SFLG/SFRG
 Invalid0:    0/0
 Left:      255/0
 Right:       0/255
 Invalid1:  255/255

perhaps we ignore intermediate values, for
purposes of tile clocks? So TRAK records the
current phase and only switches it on 'clean' L/R
states? Maybe.

I thought I wanted to detect invalid states as
clock edges, but of course we can detect edges
just from L/R.

Let's try making a 'clean tile clock' in TRAK and
see how it goes.[78:

Sat Jan 18 01:56:26 2025 Do we want the clock in
TRAK at all? Should we put it somewhere else in
xbar.GREYS? We could develop a 'rear tile clock'
just as well, but SRRG and SRLG aren't delivered
to TRAK.[79:

Sat Jan 18 02:21:05 2025 WTF, let's make CLOK[80:

Sun Jan 19 08:01:03 2025 Well, have a start at
CLOK and have been watching it go for a while
here. Thinking it's time for it to do a little
more data reducing and then start shipping the
result somewhere.

And wanted to ship it to a 'tile counter' of some
kind, but wasn't sure if I really wanted to make a
new xbar in BeeveeBIM.dtoml to put the tile
counter inside of.

Was kind of wishing I could just declare a single
atom of something and have BIM processing arrange
to get it to pop up there.

Want to take a quick look see if something like
that might be easy..[81:

Sun Jan 19 08:54:32 2025 Well of course not so
easy. Letting BIM processing rest for now; making
a 1x1 xbar intended for tile counting and stuff.

Now waiting for one more render to state before
rebuilding Beevee's brain again..

:80].

[82:

Mon Jan 20 09:48:54 2025 OK where are we? Can we
claim some to-dos?
[88:

Mon Jan 20 09:50:30 2025 We could! Fun! And I said
so!

So it's time to brainstorm reinventing ORIENT to
be edge-based instead of the stochastic
dead-reckoning that never worked well enough to
count on.

[89:

Tue Jan 21 10:55:21 2025 OK, well, didn't get to
much implementation on the ORIENT redo, but it's
getting to be time to move the flag here.

[90:

Wed Jan 22 13:30:56 2025 OK, flag moved and what
not, and now I really really want well-behaved and
reasonably reliable turns.

To Achieve That I Want
TODO

[91:

Wed Jan 22 13:58:44 2025 What if we move
xbar.GTLGREY a little further east, and moved GTCC
up into that same tile, with a connection from
CLOK and to TRAK?[92:

Wed Jan 22 15:38:48 2025 OK, hacking away in
CLOK.ulam etc but need to break to cook dinner.
Currently not buildable so lots of reminders where
we are..[93:

Wed Jan 22 15:44:24 2025 Well maybe have a little
more time here..

:93]

:92]

:91]
[94:

Thu Jan 23 08:46:16 2025 OK, so it looks like GTCC
is plausibly tracking the rear grey clok status
as well as the front grey clok.
[96:

Thu Jan 23 08:57:02 2025 Well that let us check
off one whole to-do.. So how shall we have TRAK
accept control inputs?

I would think we'd want to send stuff to TRAKPD,
have TRAKPD buffer it locally, and have TRAK
consult TRAKPD ad lib.

Issues:
 - Speed control: max, (min?,) ramp?
 - Turn control
 - Sequencing

Wheel speed sequencing seems to cover almost
everything.. But it's also about configuring
feedback loops rather than strict top-down (or
inside-out) control.

[97:

Thu Jan 23 09:03:14 2025 If we 'just' wanted to be
able to set TRAKPD.mTargetSpeed, and have TRAK try
to work to respect that, how might we do that?
(Also, what might we test that with as we do.)

[98:

Thu Jan 23 09:06:24 2025 So at TRAK.ulam:402 we
could intervene to check pd.mTargetSpeed, for
starters. That's immediate. How about deceleration
though? [99:

Thu Jan 23 11:59:54 2025 OK so with a huge
ill-understood hammer we now have TRAK.mSpeed
following TRAKPD.mTargetSpeed, and so now we have
Beevee absolutely stopped dead since there's
nobody to set mTargetSpeed to anything.[100:

Fri Jan 24 12:18:22 2025 Well, we also tried
Beevee at mTargetSpeed = -1, and it was partially
plausible.. it kept the front center on the line
as it backed up slowly, but the rear got further
and further off the line, until the front pulled
off the line, and then it seemed to be turning in
the wrong direction attempting to re-find the
line.. but it wasn't completely clear.

Anyway, speeds in like [0..15] or so seem
reasonably stable for holding the line, while at
perhaps 18 or so it seems like it can't hold the
line very long.. and anything above perhaps 6 or 8
struggles to reaquire the line once off it.

[101:

Fri Jan 24 12:24:03 2025 But we need to switch to
max/min speed rather than a single target. And
while I'm tearing things up, I also want:

 - maybe change FP30 to like FixedPoint(7u,3u)
   instead of the current FixedPoint(7u,7u).
   Absolutely do not need seven bits of fraction
   for speeds.

[102:

Sat Jan 25 10:52:50 2025 OK, so
TRAKPD.mTarget(Max|Min)Speed seems to be working
pretty okay.

We have to have to get some idea how we're going
to do

 - distance-based speed control, and
 - turn control
 - who does it,
 - where, and
 - how are the controls distributed

[104:

Sat Jan 25 10:57:02 2025 OK, so more

TODO

 - Review/develop ideas for :102: above
 - Define some kind of 'command struct', able to
   represent things like 'straight 3 tiles', 'turn
   right 90', 'turn left 180'.
 - Make or mod a unit to execute a single given
   command struct, and maintain state representing
   in-progress / success / failure
 - Make a spike element to sit near the executor
   and give it a random command whenever it's not
   'in-progress'
 - Be amused by all its failures to work
 - See it start kinda working and laugh at that too.
 - Claim to-dos and
 - Make some more to-dos.

[105:

Sat Jan 25 11:10:35 2025 OK who does this? GTCC
has clock edges and tile count, so it or something
near it would make sense.

Who is going to sequence a turn?

I can't not be thinking about some FreeWormBase
thing to hold command sequences..
[106:

Sat Jan 25 11:39:44 2025 WTF let's daydream about
an instruction set for a few minutes.

command
setmax
setmin
setdist

well let's think in terms of registers first.

max speed target
min speed target
remaining action count
current action
  (action: fwd, right, left, ??)


then have read and write registers..

[107:

Sat Jan 25 12:33:04 2025 I'm thinking the
'obvious' approach is to fit an instruction into a
SlotSig and transport them via Axons. That's 8b a
pop, right?

INSN: OP ARGS
OP 2b
  rd 00 + REG VAL
  wr 01 + REG VAL
  do 10 + DO-OP
  xo 11 + XOP
REG 2b
  min 00 min speed target
  max 01 max speed target
  cnt 10 remaining action count
  act 11 act/status
DO-OP
  noop

[108:

Sat Jan 25 12:45:34 2025 Or maybe

OP 1b
 RD + reg + val
 WR + reg + val

REG 2b
  MIN 00 min speed target
  MAX 01 max speed target
  CNT 10 remaining action count
  ACT 11 act/status

VAL 5b

with writing to ACT being the way to
initiate/change actions.

ACT reg
 noop
 drive
 turnR
 turnL
 grip

[109:

Sat Jan 25 12:59:51 2025 I guess one question is
when do we retire insns? Are we going to make this
all synchronous? So after writing ACT, we don't do
any more insns until remaining action count
becomes zoer? That seems less fun.

Vs a test-action-count op, I guess

Expand REG to 3b?

Could CNT/ACT be on a little stack? Then we could
have jump fwd/back ops that could use CNT as
distance to jump, and then return.. to what.. do
we even need a stack for that?

not sure if axon/slotsig semantics supports
skipping backwards in any natural fashion..
[110:

Sun Jan 26 00:01:34 2025 Oright come on here. Fish
or cut bait.

Are we thinking TRAKPD will hold these
'registers'? And GTCC will supply the instruction
stream? Is that even plausible?[111:

Sun Jan 26 00:04:38 2025 TRAKPD currently has 7b
available, or 30b if we ditch the mIntegralErrors
that we're not using. With 30b, we could give it -

 - a Bits(8) instruction register
 - an Unsigned(7) action count
 - maybe a Bits(8) 'act/status' reg?

and still have 7b to go.. Not completely clear
what act/status is or whether that's completely
disjoint from an instruction register.
[112:

Sun Jan 26 00:26:04 2025 So if TRAKPD is the
'tracked motion processor', how do we get
instructions to it? What are the requirements to
grow an axon to something, for example? Does it
have to be a TAP with a TapIdx? It does
right?[113:

Sun Jan 26 00:30:16 2025 Well, maybe it could have
.. hmm wait.. what is the relationship between
BeeveeBIM.cTAPClassIds[] and
TermTargetLibrary.cTARGET_IDS ? Are they both in
use?
[114:

Sun Jan 26 00:35:41 2025 I'm going to sleep but I
think we need to take the time to officially tear
out TermTarget.ulam fix up any lingering uses. I
think it is meant to be strictly dominated by
BeeveeBIM.dtoml/.ulam
[115:

Sun Jan 26 08:22:37 2025 Well, there's lots of
live hits still on TermTargetLibrary, mainly of
the form

    TermTargetLibrary ttl;
 .. ClassId srcid = ttl.getClassIdFromTapIdx(iss.mSource);

Do we know exactly what we're supposed to replace
that with? Can we? [116:

Sun Jan 26 08:25:28 2025 I guess it's
BeeveeBIM.getTAPClassIdFromTapIdx(iss.mSource)?
(Which does drive home it's got to be a TAP..)
[117:

Sun Jan 26 09:20:37 2025 Also I guess we want to
ditch TermTarget and DeliverTerm.. I guess
TermTarget is replaced by XBInfo?[118:

Sun Jan 26 11:35:10 2025 So it appears we never
gave XBInfo the ability to return an absolute
position for a tap inside an xbar? But
TermTargetLibrary could do that via its
cDESTS_(X|Y) constant arrays.

[119:

Mon Jan 27 03:11:34 2025 So, TRAKPD is a like a
methylation on TRAK, right? So we could route
insns to TRAK (which is a TAP etc), and it could
forward to TRAKPD as helpful, right?
[120:

Mon Jan 27 10:30:32 2025 OK so we made a 'quark
SeqCore' and put it in TRAKPD. Could we make say
GTCC try to send a signal to TRAK, that is meant
for TRAKPD? We'd like to try that just to find out
whether or how close we are to being able to send
signals in both directions on an axon..

Let's have GTCC try to send a NOP or something at
random intervals..
[121:

Mon Jan 27 11:34:27 2025 Well, let's say it'll
just read the current speed, maybe? That's noopy
enough for a test, right?

[122:

Mon Jan 27 11:38:07 2025 But hmm, I was imagining
read instructions were going to be self-modifying
code, storing the read value in the immediate
field.. but that makes no sense unless we send the
modified/retired insn back to GTCC.. but that
would be taking the same path [123:

Mon Jan 27 12:14:31 2025 So no, it's CLOK sending
to GTCC. If we had a path from GTCC to TRAK (to
TRAKPD), there'd be nothing currently traveling
the other direction.

Shall we perhaps let's try to make such a path?
BeeveeBIM.dtoml, away!
[124:

Mon Jan 27 12:46:57 2025 OK looks like we have two
floodfinds - started far apart - blocking each
other from succeeding. I think it's time to
energize the 'cFS_DIE' FloodState a little harder.

How about, if two unrelated floods encounter each
other, whichever one has the shorter path dies?

Let's give it a shot.[125:

Mon Jan 27 14:03:09 2025 OK, FloodFind API has a
new isCompatible(FloodFind &) to decide if another
FF can be tolerated in our sitatuion. Having
rich-get-richer works well, even if I don't like
it. But at least it reminds us that
rich-get-richer isn't so bad as long as the rich
are guaranteed to die and leave no inheritance -
but at the moment FloodFind is not gteed to die,
is it?

:125]

:121]

:120]
:119]
[126:

Tue Jan 28 09:37:11 2025 OK the t2sday update
countdown has started but I want one more bit of
progress. I want a controlled turn.

GTCC currently has 20b open. Let's just spike a
little state machine in there to do a left (say)
turn.. Hack it, fix it, see it, love it, repeat
til time runs out.
[127:

Tue Jan 28 10:29:23 2025 OK how do we tell from a
GTCC that an edge has just occured?[128:

Tue Jan 28 10:35:27 2025 So, GTCC knows an edge
occurs when it increments its own mTilesInGrip.
Which we could ditch in favor of calling an edge
method on the controller spike.. or we could
assemble a little state/event vector that we'd
pass to the controller along with the GTCC..

Now, I'd think if we go purely on the edge timers
we'd have no way to get Beevee to stop with his
rear greys directly on a line.. but so what, at
the level we're at?
[129:

Tue Jan 28 11:08:04 2025 OK so here we are again:
Is this state machine going to be (mostly)
action-triggered or (mostly) time-triggered?

[130:

Tue Jan 28 11:27:02 2025 Well let's say
action-triggered, with time as a 'backstop
action', and see how snarled up we get.

:130]

:129]
:128]

:127]
:126]
[131:

Tue Jan 28 15:32:00 2025 OK so I don't see how my
'ooh so risc' read/write register ISA really makes
any sense in context. At least because single byte
insns are just too small.

So instead we're going to make it more like

    typedef Unsigned(4u) OpCode;
    typedef Unsigned(4u) OpVal;

and make various special cases for what we want to
get the job done.

 Speed codes:
  0x0  -8   0x4   0   0x8   4   0xc  15
  0x1  -4   0x5   1   0x9   6   0xd  20
  0x2  -2   0x6   2   0xa   8   0xe  25
  0x3  -1   0x7   3   0xb  10   0xf  30

or maybe

  0x0  -4   0x4   0   0x8   4   0xc  20
  0x1  -3   0x5   1   0x9   5   0xd  25
  0x2  -2   0x6   2   0xa  10   0xe  30
  0x3  -1   0x7   3   0xb  15   0xf  --

with 0xf meaning 'no change'

 Op codes:
  0x0 setmax    0x4           0x8           0xc
  0x1 setmin    0x5           0x9           0xd
  0x2 setleft   0x6           0xa           0xe
  0x3 setright  0x7           0xb           0xf

with some kind of way of having TRAKPD remember
whether it's in 'max/min' mode (bottom-up) or
'left/right' mode (top-down).

Then we send (randomly chosen) max/mins in cGOST,
and left/rights in cTURN? Or can we take another
bit and toggle what we send?[132:

Tue Jan 28 16:06:47 2025 OK at the moment we're
trying to send a Bool to represent a clock edge,
but (as uuuuuuuusual) I think we need to send
a tristate so callee can see transitions to
invalid and valid clock states. At least, we want
to see transition-to-valid to know when we've
reached the next line during a turn..

And we already have that - we should be sending
GreyClok.ClokState values. Let's tear it up now
rather than later.[133:

Tue Jan 28 16:12:01 2025 Making DTU.ClokState.
[134:

Tue Jan 28 16:44:44 2025 OK, getting closer to
issuing potentially meaningful insns. Need to
represent that speed code crap somewhere and
stuff. 

:134]
:133]

:132]

:131]
[135:

Wed Jan 29 00:46:41 2025 So, current issue is we
want to deliver 'speedo' opcodes to TRAKPD while
we're in a virtual method. So even though we've
done the work to develop a TRAKPD & local variable
farther up the stack, we can't see it from inside
this callback. 

So that's aggravating. Common enough, of course..
and aggravating.

And we've only got 1b left in TRAK if we were even
willing to think about passing the signal out that
way.. which we're absolutely not.[136:

Wed Jan 29 00:54:08 2025 Could we just break down
and make TRAKPD a TAP, rather than a wart attached
to TRAK? That's one story about why we're having
this problem now.[137:

Wed Jan 29 11:32:52 2025 Well, TRAKPD isa TAP now,
and we're getting pretty close, I think, to seeing
some turn control actually happen. We shall see.

:137]

:136]

:135]
